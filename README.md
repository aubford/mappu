Mappu
=====

Yet another web gis (with social taste).

What is Mappu?
--------------

Mappu is a web-based gis which strives to:

- be aesteticaly pleasing
- be as simple as possible to setup and use
- provide social functionality on top of your existing GIS data
- simplify the process of linking data to gis and viceversa

Getting Mappu
-------------

I'm working on a vagrant script that will make it as easy as
possible to provision a vm with all the necessary software
installed automatically.

The script is in the *vagrant* folder.

Screenshot/demo
---------------

Screenhots are hosted in the media folder.

A demo is available on a temporary cloud server:
